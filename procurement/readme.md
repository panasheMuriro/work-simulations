# Zimbabwean Procurement Internship Simulation

A **web-based interactive simulation** for a Zimbabwean procurement internship.  
Users take the role of a procurement intern and make decisions across multiple days. AI agents (Finance, Warehouse, Supplier, Logistics, Legal, Mentor) evaluate these decisions and provide real-time feedback.

## üíª Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/procurement-internship-sim.git
cd procurement-internship-sim
````

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Linux / macOS
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Setup LLM (Local Ollama)

```bash
# Install Ollama
ollama pull mistral
```

> The default LLM is **Ollama LLaMA 3.2**. You can change to other providers (OpenAI, Google Gemma, TogetherAI) by editing `LLM` setup in `app.py`.

### 5. Run the Streamlit app

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## üìù Usage

1. Select a **Scenario/Day** from the sidebar.
2. Read the scenario details (warehouse request, budget, suppliers, special events).
3. Enter your decision in the **User Decision** text box (supplier, quantities, justification).
4. Click **Submit Decision**.
5. Watch AI agents evaluate your decision in real-time and provide feedback.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization

* Extend `SCENARIOS` with more days, suppliers, and events.
* Adjust agent behavior by modifying `build_*_agent()` functions.
* Swap LLM backends by changing the `LLM` initialization.
